# AI Swarm - API GraphQL

This plugin provides a GraphQL API for the AI Swarm, wrapping most core function of the API interface provided by the [Orchestrator](https://github.com/aiswarm/orchestrator). The plugin provides Queries, Mutations, and Subscriptions for all common operations. It's main use is to provide a way to interact with the AI Swarm from a web interface, but can be adapted to other use cases.

If you're looking for an easy way to get started with the AI Swarm, check out the [Conductor](https://github.com/aiswarm/conductor) project.
